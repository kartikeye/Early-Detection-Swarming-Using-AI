This project tackles the challenge of data imbalance in audio datasets, focusing on bee bioacoustics to detect and classify bee sounds, such as swarming events, essential for effective beekeeping management. The methodologies employed include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for data augmentation and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for classification.

Initially, audio samples of bee sounds were collected from the internet, including both piping and non-piping sounds. Due to the scarcity of piping audio samples, the dataset was highly imbalanced. GANs were utilised to generate synthetic audio data, balancing the class distribution. The GAN framework comprises a generator creating synthetic audio from random noise and a discriminator evaluating these samples' authenticity. The generator improves its ability to produce realistic audio segments through adversarial training.

The augmented dataset underwent preprocessing steps, including noise reduction, segmentation, and feature extraction using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). These features were then used as inputs for the LSTM network, which was chosen for its capability to handle sequential data and capture temporal dependencies.

Results demonstrated that GAN-based data augmentation significantly enhanced the model's performance on imbalanced datasets. This methodology has broader applications beyond bee bioacoustics, offering potential solutions for any audio dataset facing imbalance issues. In conclusion, this project presents a comprehensive approach to addressing data imbalance using GANs and LSTMs, contributing to more effective beekeeping practices and advancing audio processing in machine learning.
